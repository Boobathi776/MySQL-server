🔥 Trigger Practice Questions (Based on your InventoryDB)
🔁 1. Auto-update stock on order
❓ When a new row is inserted into OrderDetails, reduce the item’s stock in Inventory.

📌 Challenge: Prevent stock going negative.

🧮 2. Recalculate total amount
❓ When OrderDetails is inserted, updated, or deleted, automatically update TotalAmount in Orders.

📌 Hint: Use AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

📝 3. Stock change log
❓ Every time stock changes (due to order or return), insert a record into StockLog.

📌 Columns: ItemID, QuantityChanged, ChangeType (e.g., Sale, Return), ReferenceID, ChangedBy.

❌ 4. Block blacklisted customer from ordering
❓ If a blacklisted customer tries to place an order, prevent it using an INSTEAD OF INSERT trigger on Orders.

🔄 5. Trigger restock alert
❓ If inserting an OrderDetails reduces stock below ReOrderLevel, auto-insert a record into RestockRequests (only if not already pending).

📊 6. Track price updates
❓ When Inventory.Price is updated, log the old and new value in ItemAudit.

📌 Columns: ChangeType = 'Price Update', OldValue, NewValue, ChangedBy.

🧼 7. Return stock adjustment
❓ When a return is processed in the Returns table, increase stock of that item.

Also, log it in StockLog with ChangeType = 'Return'.

👀 8. Flag fraudulent behavior
❓ If a customer returns more than 3 items in the last 7 days, insert a record in FraudAlerts.

📌 Trigger on Returns.

🚫 9. Prevent excessive discounting
❓ If any OrderDetails.Price is more than 30% lower than the current price of that item in Inventory, reject the insert.

📌 10. Audit quantity changes
❓ If the Inventory.Stock is manually updated (via update query), log both old and new values into ItemAudit.
